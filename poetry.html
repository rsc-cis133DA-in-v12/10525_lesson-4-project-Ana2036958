            <h2>In Memoriam
            </h2>
            <p>By Alfred Tennyson</p>
            <p><b>I envy not in any moods The captive void of noble rage, The linnet born within the cage, That never knew the summer woods:</b></p>
            <p>I envy not the beast that takes His license in the field of time, Unfetter'd by the sense of crime, To whom a conscience never wakes;</p>
            <p><em>Nor, what may count itself as blest, The heart that never plighted troth But stagnates in the weeds of sloth; Nor any want-begotten rest.</em></p>
            <p>I hold it true, whate'er befall; I feel it, when I sorrow most; 'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all.</p><!--<p>the pain of lost love is worth bearing to experience the joy of love</p>-->
